# Counter App

## Overview

The Counter App is a simple JavaScript application that allows users to increase, decrease, or reset a numerical counter. The app dynamically updates the counter's value and changes the text color based on whether the value is positive, negative, or zero. This project is great for beginners to learn and practice DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Increase the Counter**: Increment the counter value by 1.
- **Decrease the Counter**: Decrement the counter value by 1.
- **Reset the Counter**: Reset the counter value to 0.
- **Dynamic Text Color**: Counter value changes color:
    - Green for positive values
    - Red for negative values
    - Black for zero

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the app
- **CSS**: Basic styling
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation and event handling

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/counter-app.git
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```
    cd counter-app
    ```
    
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view and use the app.

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of:

- Selecting and manipulating DOM elements using JavaScript
- Adding event listeners to elements
- Debugging and testing small JavaScript projects

## Future Enhancements

Some ideas for future improvements:

- Add animations when the counter value changes.
- Store the counter value in local storage so it persists between sessions.
- Create additional styles and themes.
